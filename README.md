# Immersive Soundscape
### Created by Chinmay Pai for IMGD 5100

This is an immersive soundscape meant to simulate a busy street and railway station in Mumbai. The models on screen are simplified to ensure that the focus of the project is on the audio. 

The 3D audio has been simulated using [Resonance Audio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/).
